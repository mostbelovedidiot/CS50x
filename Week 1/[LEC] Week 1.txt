Basic Elements of Code, Techniques of Writing Code, Linux Commands
===================================================================================
compiler
-------------------------------------------------------
    compilers can translate between the following:
        1) machine code (binary, 0s & 1s) -> source code (higher-level languages)
        2) source code -> source code [eg: c to c++ or java to yourmother'sfatass]

c variables
-------------------------------------------------------
    strings = string ____
        string fuckyou = "fuck you fucking retard"
    integers = int
        int idiot = 420
        idiot++
    single character = char
        char whyisthisathing = a
    constant = const int
        makes a variable unchangeable in its value (const int n = 3)

types (some is CS-50 exclusive)
-------------------------------------------------------
    types   explanation             printf call
    -------------------------------------------------------
    bool    true/false (boolean)    
    char    single char             %c
    double  big decimal             %f
    float   small decimal           %f
    int     small whole number      %i
    long    large whole number      %li
    string  string of chars         %
    pointer address of a variable   %p
        ->int a = 55;
	    printf("The address of a is %p", &a);
    *numbers are stored as 4 bytes (32 bits), or 8 bytes (64 bits) for double and long
    *so x64 architecture is literally the ability to store longer numbers, more specifically by adding 8 new 64-bit registers and zero-extending (adding zeroes) to the 32-bit registers

Linux Commands
-------------------------------------------------------
        -R  recursive   (capitalization matters, especially when using commands that utilize a different -r such as chmod)
        -v  verbose

    cd:     changing our current directory (folder)
    cp:     copying files and directories
        -> utilitize -r to copy the directory
    ls:     listing files in a directory
    mkdir:  for making a directory
    mv:     moving (renaming) files and directories
    rm:     removing (deleting) files
        -> utilize -f to skip the confirmation
        -> utilize -r for directories (-rf to skip confirmation)
    rmdir:  for removing (deleting) directories

    sudo    runs commands when elevated priviledge (consider administrator on windows), these
            priviledges are considered root priviledges (root user)
    su      switch to a different user and execute a command in shell without logging out
    echo    will return a string based on the previous commands, or with a string input
        *check out its options when possible
    chmod   changes file permissions (and directories): read, write, execute
            will be far more useful when deploying code, indiicating which files are accessible to the user
        -u    user      permission to user
        -g    group     permission to group
        -o    others    permission to others
        +/-r  read      grant/remove (+r / -r)
        +/-w  write     grant/remove (+w / -w)
        +/-x  execute   grant/remove (+x / -x)
        *check out octal mode
    ln
    touch
    rmdir
    man
    diff
    clear
    telnet

magic numbers
-------------------------------------------------------
    when you have a number that represents something very critical to the logic of the code (eg: the upper limit of something which you are iterating upon which is central to the code's logic) and this number exists arbitrarily in the code without any context (eg: in a for loop)

    it is better to define magic numbers outside of the relevant code in order to readily demonstrate its purpose to the reader -- not as a global int, because this could be manipulated either within the function or elsewhere

    one solution would be to have a variable defined as a certain number, never modulate that variable, and utilize additional variables representing the manipulation of that number to be used in respective functions -- this can get messy 

    solution: utilize a pre-processed directive or macro:
    by convention, these symbolic constants are indicated by all CAPS, to not be confused with vars
        #define     NAME    REPLACEMENT
        
        example:
        #define     PI      3.14159265323
            ->all references to PI will be hardcoded to return that float
        #define     COURSE  "CS50"
